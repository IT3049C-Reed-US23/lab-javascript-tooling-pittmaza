how many points out of 10 do you deserve on this assignment: 20/20

## Self-Reflection:

I absolutely despise unit testing, I've always struggled to do it and I just stink at making tests.
I spent a significant amount of time on the final cypress test and I just hate making them, so this assignment wasn't my favorite.
Regardless, I tried my best to complete this lab!

### How long it took me to finish this?
